# Zippy

![Github action](https://github.com/status-im/nim-zippy/workflows/nim-zippy%20CI/badge.svg)

`nimble install zippy`

Zippy is an implementation of [DEFLATE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951), [ZLIB](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950) and [GZIP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952) data compression formats. Zippy can also create and open [Tarballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) (.tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, .taz) and [ZIP archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)).

The goal of this library is to be a pure Nim implementation that is small, performant and dependency-free.

Zippy can also be used at compile time. This is great for baking assets into executables in compressed form. [Check out an example here](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/blob/master/examples/compiletime.nim).

To ensure Zippy is compatible with other implementations, `tests/validate.nim` can be run. This script verifies that data compressed by Zippy can be uncompressed by other implementations (and that other implementations can uncompress data compressed by Zippy).

This library works well using Nim's relatively new `--gc:arc` and `--gc:orc` as well as the default garbage collector. This library also works using both `nim c` and `nim cpp`, in addition to `--cc:vcc` on Windows.

I have also verified that Zippy builds with `--experimental:strictFuncs` on Nim 1.4.0.

## Examples

Simple examples using Zippy can be found in the [examples/](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/blob/master/examples) folder.

* [HTTP client gzip](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/blob/master/examples/http_client.nim)
* [HTTP server gzip](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/blob/master/examples/http_server.nim)
* Compress a dir into a [tarball](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/blob/master/examples/tarball_create.nim) or [zip archive](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/blob/master/examples/ziparchive_create.nim)
* Extract from a [tarball](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/blob/master/examples/tarball_extract.nim) or [zip archive](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/blob/master/examples/ziparchive_extract.nim)
* Compose a [tarball](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/blob/master/examples/tarball_compose.nim) or [zip archive](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/blob/master/examples/ziparchive_compose.nim) in code

## Performance

Benchmarks can be run comparing different deflate implementations. My benchmarking shows this library performs very well, a bit faster than zlib in some cases and a bit slower in others. Check the performance yourself by running [tests/benchmark.nim](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/blob/master/tests/benchmark.nim).

`nim c -d:release -r .\tests\benchmark.nim`
